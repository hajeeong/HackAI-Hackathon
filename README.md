## CHALLENGE OVERVIEW

The rise of Generative Al has unlocked new ways of interacting with complex business documents. One of the most information-dense and underutilized of these is the Annual Report - a PDF packed with financials, risks, strategy, and market insights.

Your challenge is to build an application that enables users to ask natural language questions and receive meaningful answers from the contents of an annual report PDF. Your solution could be anything from a command-line tool to a conversational chatbot or even an AI Agent that assists stakeholders in understanding company performance.

Participants are free to explore creative ways through Python code to:

- Ingest and process the contents of the annual report (PDF format)

- Retrieve information from relevant sections (e.g, risk factors, financial tables, charts etc.)

- Generate human-like, helpful responses using Generative AI
